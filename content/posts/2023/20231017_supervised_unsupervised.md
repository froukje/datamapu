## Machine Learning

In classical programming the programmer defines specific rules which the program follows and these rules lead to an output. In contrast Machine Learning uses data to find the rules that describe the relationship between input and output. This process of finding the rules is called 'learning'. Supervised and Unsupervised Learning are two different types of Machine Learning.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a technique that needs labeled data. The labels are the output that we give the model to train. When training a model we try to get as close as possible to the true labels with our predicted labels.

Supervised learning uses algorithms to learn the relationship between the features and the target data. This process is referred to as Training or Fitting.

### Examples

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning that focuses on discovering patterns and relationships within data that lacks pre-existing labels or annotations. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning algorithms do not rely on labeled examples to learn from. Instead, they aim to discover inherent structures or clusters within the data.
