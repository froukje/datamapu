Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses algorithms to learn the relationship between the features and the target data. This process is referred to as Training or Fitting.

Unsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning that focuses on discovering patterns and relationships within data that lacks pre-existing labels or annotations. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning algorithms do not rely on labeled examples to learn from. Instead, they aim to discover inherent structures or clusters within the data.
