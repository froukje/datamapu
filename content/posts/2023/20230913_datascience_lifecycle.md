## The Data Science Lifecycle

When we think about Data Science, we usually think about Machine Learning modelling. However, a Data Science project consists of many more steps. Whereas modelling might be the most fun part, it is important to know, that this is only a fraction of the entire lifecycle of a Data Science project. When you plan a project and communicate how much time you need, you need to make sure, that enough time is given for all the surrounding tasks. Let's have a look at the individual steps of a Data Science project.

1. Before starting a project it is important to **Understand the Problem** you want to solve. Make sure you understand the context and ask domain experts if necessary. This is a crucial step and should not be overgone. This is also the time when you define the metrics you are interested in. This is an important decision as you will use them throughout your entire project.

2. Next you need data. If you are not very lucky and data is provided by someone else, **Data Mining** might need a lot of time. You have to think which input features you need and search for data sources to download the data. Especially, if you want to use the data for commercial purposes, don't forget to check their license.

3. Usually data downloaded from the internet needs to be **cleaned**. This includes searching for missing values, outliers or renaming columns. Sometimes you have to reformat the entries, e.g. decimal numbers might be separated by a comma, but you want to process them separated with a dot. Also have a look at the data types, maybe you want to change them, especially when you are working with dates.Before using the data for modelling you should **explore** them. This step depends on your data and the problem you want to solve. If you are solving a classification problem, you should have a look at the distributions of the data classes in the target data, to check if your data is unbalanced. If your problem is a regression, plot the target distribution to see if it follows a normal distribution or is skewed. If your target data is skewed you may want to try to make a logarithmic transformation to them, before modelling. If you have tabular data, you should also have a look at the distributions of your input features. A heatmap can show you possible correlations within your input data.

4. Sometimes you don't have the exact feature you would like to use for training in your data, then you need to do **feature engineering**. This can be a combination of two or more features you extracted or a statistical value as e.g. the mean or the standard deviation of a specific column or the entire dataset. If your feature space is very large you can consider reducing the dimensionality at this point by e.g. permorming a PCA. If you work with time series data, you may want to use the spectral components resulting from the fft in as input features instead of the time series data itself. In general feature engineering is more important for classical Machine Learning algorithms and is only rarely applied when a Deep Learning algorithm is used.

5. When the data is prepared, finally the **modelling** can start. This is the point everyone is waiting for. Divide your data in training, validation and test data and start modelling. This is a very iterative process. You can try different model types to see which one performs best on your data and of course different hyperparameter combinations. Sometimes an ensemble model, compiled of different models gives a better and less overfitting result. 

6. When you finish modelling, you need to **evaluate** your results. A first impression is often given by the metric of the model, you should however do a more detailed analysis of the results, including some plots of the predictions. This gives you the opportunity to spot any conspicuity in the results. Maybe you realize that your model is constantly predicting lower values as the true values or if you are working with data at different geographical locations you may notice that your model does not perform as well at some of the locations than at others. You will propably go back again to the previous step and make some adjustemts to the model or even to the input features to analyze whether these changes improve your results.

7. When you are finally happy with your result or simply think you cannot improve, at least not with the given data you need to **communicate** your results. For that usualy the plots and calculations you made during the evaluation are very helpful. If you want to show your model life and in action you can think of preparing a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) dashboard. Once everyone is convinced the model needs to be **deployed** so that it can finally be used. How to deploy a model is a whole chapter of its own and is usually done with the help of an MLOps colleague.

Congratulations! You now know the individual steps needed in a Data Science project. These steps are not only important for you to know as a Data Scientist, but also to the person you report your results. It is important to make clear that each of these steps need their time so that expectations of the time line are clear to everyone.
