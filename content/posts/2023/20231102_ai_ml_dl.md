## What is Deep Learning?

In this article we will learn what Deep Learning is and understand the difference to AI and Machine Learning. Often these three terms are used interchangable, they are however not the same. The following diagram illustrates how they are related.

*Relation of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning*

**Artificial Intelligence.** There are different definitions of Artificial Intelligence, but in general, they involve computers performing tasks, that are usually associated with humans or other intelligent living systems. This is the definition given on Wikimedia:
It says: “[AI is] Mimicking the intelligence or behavioral pattern of humans or any living entity”

**Machine Learning.** Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. It describes the process that a computer can “learn” from data, without a given set of rules. In practice, these terms are often not well distinguished. People often talk about ML, but refer to it as AI

**Deep Learning.** Deep Learning is a particular type of Machine Learning, which uses Neural Nets as models. Neural Nets was inspired by the way how neurons in our brain work. 

### Classical Programming vs. Machine Learning

In this article we are going to learn about Deep Learning, which as we just saw is a subset of Machine Learning. Machine Learning differs conceptionally from classical programming. In classical programming you use data and rules to get the answers to a problem.
In contrast in Machine Learning you use the data and the answers to a problem to get the rules. This is illustrated in the following chart.
