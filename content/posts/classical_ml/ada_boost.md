## Introduction

Ada Boost is an example for an [ensemble learning]({{< ref "/posts/ml_concepts/ensemble.md">}}) supervised Machine Learning model. It consists of a sequential series of models, each one focussing on the errors of the previous one, trying to improve them.

Underlying model alwys decision tree?

## The Algorithm

1. fit model
2. make predictions
3. weight dataset
4 fit model to weighted dataset
