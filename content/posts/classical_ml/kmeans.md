## Introduction

*K-Means* is an example for a *clustering* algorithm. Clustering is a fundamental concept in Machine Learning, where the goal is to group a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Clustering belongs to the set of [unsupervised]({{< ref "/posts/ml_concepts/supervised_unsupervised#unsupervised">}}) Machine Learning algorithms, that is no ground truth is needed. Among the various clustering algorithms, *K-Means* stands out for its simplicity and efficiency. In this blog post, we will explain the algorithm behind K-Means, and see how to implement it in Python.
