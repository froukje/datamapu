## Introduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction. In Data Science and Machine Learning often huge datasets with a large set of features are analysed. PCA allows to simplify complex datasets while retaining their essential information. PCA transforms a large set of correlated variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. These principal components capture the maximum variance in the data, making it easier to identify patterns, reduce noise, and improve the efficiency of machine learning models. 

## Why Use PCA?

When a dataset contains a large set of features PCA may be useful to reduce the dimensionality of the data. This **dimensionality reduction** simplifies the dataset, while maintaining the majority of the information. This may be useful for several reasons:

1. *Avoid Overfitting*: High-dimensional data can lead to overfitting in Machine Learning models. Reducing the dimensionalty may help to avoid the [curse of dimensionality]()

2. *Remove Noise:* PCA identifies and eliminates features that contribute little to the overall variance in the data and therefore removes reduntant features.

3. *Visualization:* High-dimensional data can be difficult to visualize. PCA allows to reduce the dimensions to two or three, enabling clear visual representations that help in identifying patterns, clusters, or outliers.

4. *Generate new Features:* PCA generates new features (principal components) that are linear combinations of the original features. These components can be used as inputs for machine learning models.

5. *Data Compression:* PCA can compress data by reducing the number of dimensions, which lowers storage needs without significant loss of information.
Efficient Processing: Compressed data requires less computational power and time to process, which is particularly beneficial for large datasets.

6. *Handling Multicollinearity:* When features are highly correlated, it can cause issues in regression models (e.g., multicollinearity). PCA transforms the correlated features into a set of uncorrelated principal components.
