## Introduction

*Gradient Boosting* is a type of supervised Machine Learning algorthm that is based on [*ensemble learning*]({{< ref "/posts/ml_concepts/ensemble">}}).

## The Algorithm

Gradient Boosting is as the same suggests a ensemble model that is based on [boosting]({{< ref "/posts/ml_concepts/ensemble#boosting">}}).
