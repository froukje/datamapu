## Introduction

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a specific type of Neural Networks (NNs) that are especially relevant for sequential data like time series, text, or audio data. In standard NNs all ata is treated independently. For example they are not able to capture the temporal relationship in a time series. However, when working with sequences the data often depends on data of previous time steps. A standard
