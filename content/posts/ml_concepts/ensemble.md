## Introduction

## Bagging / Bootstrap aggregation

a random sample of data in a training set is selected with replacement—meaning that the individual data points can be chosen more than once. After several data samples are generated, these models are then trained independently, and depending on the type of task—i.e. regression or classification—the average or majority of those predictions yield a more accurate estimate. This approach is commonly used to reduce variance within a noisy dataset.
