      <description>Introduction Gradient Boosting is an ensemble machine learning model, that - as the name suggests - is based on boosting. An ensemble model based on boosting refers to a model that sequentially builds models, and the new model depends on the previous model. In Gradient Boosting these models are built such that they improve the error of the previous model. These individual models are so-called weak learners, which means they have low predictive skills.</description>

      <description>Introduction A neural network consists of a set of parameters - the weights and biases - which define the outcome of the network, that is the predictions. When training a neural network we aim to adjust these weights and biases such that the predictions improve. To achieve that Backpropagation is used. In this post, we discuss how backpropagation works, and explain it in detail for four simple examples. The first two examples will contain all the calculations, the last two will only illustrate the equations that need to be calculated.</description>

      <description>Introduction Gradient Descent is a mathematical optimization technique, which is used to find local minima of a function. In Machine Learning it is used in a variety of models such as Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks to minimize the Loss Function. It is an iterative algorithm that takes small steps towards the minimum in every iteration. The idea is to start at a random point and then take a small step into the direction of the steepest descent of this point.</description>

      <description>Introduction In Machine Learning Loss Functions are used to evaluate the model. They compare the true target values with the predicted ones and are directly related to the error of the predictions. During the training of a model, the Loss Function is aimed to be optimized to minimize the error of the predictions. It is a general convention to define a Loss Function such that it is minimized rather than maximized.</description>

      <description>Introduction Gradient Boosting, also called Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is a type of supervised Machine Learning algorithm that is based on ensemble learning. It consists of a sequential series of models, each one trying to improve the errors of the previous one. It can be used for both regression and classification tasks. In this post, we introduce the algorithm and then explain it in detail for a regression task. We will look at the general formulation of the algorithm and then derive and simplify the individual steps for the most common use case, which uses Decision Trees as underlying models and a variation of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as loss function.</description>

      <description>Introduction AdaBoost is an ensemble model that sequentially builds new models based on the errors of the previous model to improve the predictions. The most common case is to use Decision Trees as base models. Very often the examples explained are for classification tasks. AdaBoost can, however, also be used for regression problems. This is what we will focus on in this post. This article covers the detailed calculations of a simplified example.</description>

      <description>Introduction AdaBoost is an ensemble model that is based on Boosting. The individual models are so-called weak learners, which means that they have only little predictive skill, and they are sequentially built to improve the errors of the previous one. A detailed description of the Algorithm can be found in the separate article AdaBoost - Explained. In this post, we will focus on a concrete example for a classification task and develop the final ensemble model in detail.</description>

      <description>Introduction AdaBoost is an example of an ensemble supervised Machine Learning model. It consists of a sequential series of models, each one focussing on the errors of the previous one, trying to improve them. The most common underlying model is the Decision Tree, other models are however possible. In this post, we will introduce the algorithm of AdaBoost and have a look at a simplified example for a classification task using sklearn.</description>

      <description>Introduction In Machine Learning different error sources exist. Some errors cannot be avoided, for example, due to unknown variables in the system analyzed. These errors are called irreducible errors. On the other hand, reducible errors, are errors that can be reduced to improve the model&amp;rsquo;s skill. Bias and Variance are two of the latter. They are concepts used in supervised Machine Learning to evaluate the model&amp;rsquo;s output compared to the true values.</description>

      <description>Introduction In Ensemble Learning multiple Machine Learning models are combined into one single prediction to improve the predictive skill. The individual models can be of different types or the same. Ensemble learning is based on &amp;ldquo;the wisdom of the crowds&amp;rdquo;, which assumes that the expected value of multiple estimates is more accurate than a single estimate. Ensemble learning can be used for regression or classification tasks. Three main types of Ensemble Learning method are most common.</description>

      <description>Introduction A Random Forest is a supervised Machine Learning model, that is built on Decision Trees. To understand how a Random Forest works, you should be familiar with Decision Trees. You can find an introduction in the separate article Decision Trees - Explained. A major disadvantage of Decision Trees is that they tend to overfit and often have difficulties to generalize to new data. Random Forests try to overcome this weakness.</description>

      <description>Introduction Decision Trees are a powerful, yet simple Machine Learning Model. An advantage of their simplicity is that we can build and understand them step by step. In this post, we are looking at a simplified example to build an entire Decision Tree by hand for a classification task. After calculating the tree, we will use the sklearn package and compare the results.

      <description>Introduction A Decision Tree is a supervised Machine Learning algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification problems. It is a non-parametric model, which means there is no specific mathematical function underlying to fit the data (in contrast to e.g. Linear Regression or Logistic Regression), but the algorithm only learns from the data itself. Decision Trees learn rules for decision making and used to be drawn manually before Machine Learning came up.</description>

      <description>Introduction Feature Selection is the process of determining the most suitable subset of the total number of available features for modeling. It helps to understand which features contribute most to the target data. This is usefull to&#xA;Improve Model Performance. Redundant and irrelevant features may be misleading for the model. Additionally, if the feature space is too large compared to the sample size. This is called the curse of dimensionality and may reduce the model&amp;rsquo;s performance.</description>

      <description>Introduction Logistic Regression is a Supervised Machine Learning algorithm, in which a model is developed, that relates the target variable to one or more input variables (features). However, in contrast to Linear Regression the target (dependent) variable is not numerical, but categorical. That is the target variable can be classified in different categories (e.g.: &amp;rsquo;test passed&amp;rsquo; or &amp;rsquo;test not passed&amp;rsquo;). An idealized example of two categories for the target variable is illustrated in the plot below.</description>

      <description>Introduction Linear Regression is a type of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm, where a linear relationship between the input feature(s) and the target value is assumed. Linear Regression is a specific type of regression model, where the mapping learned by the model describes a linear function. As in all regression tasks, the target variable is continuous. In a linear regression, the linear relationship between one (Simple Linear Regression) or more (Multiple Linear Regression) independent variable and one dependent variable is modeled.</description>

      <description>Machine Learning In classical programming, the programmer defines specific rules which the program follows and these rules lead to an output. In contrast, Machine Learning uses data to find the rules that describe the relationship between input and output. This process of finding the rules is called &amp;rsquo;learning&amp;rsquo;. Supervised and Unsupervised Learning are two different types of Machine Learning. Let&amp;rsquo;s discover what each means.&#xA;Fig. 1: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning are different types of Machine Learning.</description>

      <description>Classification Problems Supervised Machine Learning projects can be divided into regression and classification problems. In regression problems, we predict a continuous variable (e.g. temperature), while in classification, we classify the data into discrete classes (e.g. classify cat and dog images). A subset of classification problems is the so-called binary classification, where only two classes are considered. An example of this is classifying e-mails as spam and no-spam or cat images versus dog images.</description>

      <description>Introduction When we think about Data Science, we usually think about Machine Learning modeling. However, a Data Science project consists of many more steps. Whereas modelling might be the most fun part, it is important to know that this is only a fraction of the entire lifecycle of a Data Science project. When we plan a project and communicate how much time we need, we need to make sure that enough time is given for all the surrounding tasks.</description>
