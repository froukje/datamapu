      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A neural network consists of a set of parameters - the weights and biases - which define the outcome of the network, that is the predictions. When training a neural network we aim to adjust these weights and biases such that the predictions improve. To achieve that &lt;em&gt;Backpropagation&lt;/em&gt; is used. In this post, we discuss how backpropagation works, and explain it in detail for four simple examples. The first two examples will contain all the calculations, the last two will only illustrate the equations that need to be calculated. Additionally, the general formulation is shown, but without going into details.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
