      <description>Introduction In this post, we develop a Gradient Boosting model for a binary classification. We focus on the calculations of each single step for a specific example chosen. For a more general explanation of the algorithm and the derivation of the formulas for the individual steps, please refer to Gradient Boost for Classification - Explained and Gradient Boost for Regression - Explained. Additionally, we show a simple example of how to apply Gradient Boosting for classification in Python.</description>

      <description>Introduction Gradient Boosting is an ensemble machine learning model, that - as the name suggests - is based on boosting. An ensemble model based on boosting refers to a model that sequentially builds models, and the new model depends on the previous model. In Gradient Boosting these models are built such that they improve the error of the previous model. These individual models are so-called weak learners, which means they have low predictive skills.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this post, we will go through the development of a Gradient Boosting model for a regression problem, considering a simplified example. We calculate the individual steps in detail, which are defined and explained in the separate post Gradient Boost for Regression - Explained. Please refer to this post for a more general and detailed explanation of the algorithm.&#xA;Data We will use a simplified dataset consisting of only 10 samples, which describes how many meters a person has climbed, depending on their age, whether they like height, and whether they like goats.</description>

      <description>Introduction Gradient Boosting, also called Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is a type of supervised Machine Learning algorithm that is based on ensemble learning. It consists of a sequential series of models, each one trying to improve the errors of the previous one. It can be used for both regression and classification tasks. In this post, we introduce the algorithm and then explain it in detail for a regression task. We will look at the general formulation of the algorithm and then derive and simplify the individual steps for the most common use case, which uses Decision Trees as underlying models and a variation of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as loss function.</description>
